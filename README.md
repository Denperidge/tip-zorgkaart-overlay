# Transgender Infopunt Zorgkaart Goggles

This is the monorepo for TIP Zorgkaart Goggles; a webpage and [browser extension](browser-extension/) that overlays the different care providers with the positive & negative experiences of other trans people.

> Hopefully obvious note: the data provided here is by and for trans people looking for a safe place for care. Using this data for the sake of harassing care providers, even if they are marked negatively, is counter-intuitive to the real long-term improvements needed for trans care.
